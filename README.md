#ReadySet VOLUNTEER MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

##SPECIFICATIONS:

On the **start-up window** the user can choose between **Log in/out, Settings and Exit.**

##SETTINGS:

• Project management: when selected, a standard project form can be filled out and a new project can be added. Volunteers then are able to choose between the various projects entered into the system when they log on.
• Exit
• ? (more can be added later)

##LOG IN/OUT:
The **initial log in/out window** will give the user four options:

1. First time volunteer
2. Volunteer
3. Guest
4. Exit

###First time volunteer:

The **first time volunteer window** will have the **standard volunteer form**ls that the user will fill out and the option to Exit. The program will then save the form and add the volunteer's name to the list of volunteers. It will tell the user that they can now log on as a volunteer and then the volunteer is transferred (after selecting **Continue**) to the **initial log on/off window**

###Volunteer:

The volunteer window will ask the user to select their name from a scroll down list.
If the volunteer has been logged on already a log off window will open asking the user for:

1. The date and time
2. (and there could be the option of writing a note: observation, request etc.)
3. Exit

###If the volunteer is not logged on already, a log on window will open and ask the user for:

1. date and time
2. project they plan on working on - the user can select from a scroll down list of projects (entered into the program under the settings option) or they can select other and enter manually another reason for coming to Rosewood
3. Perhaps: a window for additional notes, requests, observations

###Guest:

The initial guest window will contain three choices: log on, log out, Exit

###Log on:

####The guest log on window will ask the user to:

1. input name (first and last)
2. if they have not logged out from their previous visit the user will be transferred to the log out window
and asked to log out first, before they can proceed with logging on.
3. enter date and time
4. enter reason for visit (there will be a scroll down list of choices or the user can select other and manually
enter the reason for their visit.)
5. Exit

####Log off:

The guest log off window will ask the user to:

1. select their name from a scroll down list
2. enter date and time
3. Exit

####Exit:

The user is returned to the initial log in/out window

##EXIT:

Exits the user from the program.

##ADMINISTRATIVE USE OF THE SOFTWARE:

- The log in/out data will be save in a database which then can be accessed and used independently of the ReadySet
volunteer management software
- The standard volunteer forms will be saved as OpenOffice documents into a folder on the computer, and will be
accessible without using the ReadySet volunteer management software.
- The standard project forms will be saved as OpenOffice documents into a folder on the computer and will be
accessible without having to run the volunteer management software.
